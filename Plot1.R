##Assignment2
# Question 1:
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to
# 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5
# emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

##Read dataset into R 
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

totalPM25ByYear <- tapply(NEI$Emissions, NEI$year, sum)


png("plot1.png", width=480, height=480)
plot(names(totalPM25ByYear), totalPM25ByYear, type = "l",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = expression("Total" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions (tons)"),
     main = expression("Total US" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions by Year"))
dev.off()
